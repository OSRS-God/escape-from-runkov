// What an enemy is. The enemies themselves come from worlds.ts: each map's
// from worlds.json, keyed by OSRS NPC id (the folder under
// public/assets/npcs). Each has idle, walk, attack and death clips in its
// model.glb, and attack, hit and death sounds beside it.
//
// Balance: scripts/balance.ts plays the maps on paper. The aim is that the
// gear a map's chests give beats the map after it with some food, and its
// boss falls to one tier better than that.

// A second form rises with this share of the first's hitpoints; since
// version 150 the two together are what the boss's tier gives it, not
// that and this much again
