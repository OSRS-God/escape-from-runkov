// The test characters' kit: a crowned browser's second character (save.ts's
// slots) is for trying things, so it keeps every item in the game in its
// stash, for good (version 82; version 80 gave the owner's a Saradomin rune
// set and godsword, which this includes). Only a browser holding a crown key
// (crown.ts), the owner's or the playtester's, playing its second character,
// has it. Whatever of it is short, worn, packed and stashed together, is
// topped back up in the stash whenever the save is looked at (the page
// opening, a run ending), unworn, so a death, a drop or a meal costs nothing
// of it; it can't be sold, and it stays out of gravestones so coming back
// doesn't make two.
